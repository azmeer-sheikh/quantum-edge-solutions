## 💡 Navigation Tips

**From Main Site to BCS Pages:**
The BCS landing pages are separate from the Quantum Edge Solutions main website. They don't appear in the main navigation.

**Between BCS Pages:**
Use the footer links in the "Service Areas" section to navigate between the 5 city pages.

**Back to Main Site:**
Change the URL hash to go back to Quantum Edge Solutions:
- Home: `https://your-domain.com/#home`
- Services: `https://your-domain.com/#services`
- Portfolio: `https://your-domain.com/#portfolio`
